1). You are working on a flight booking system that displays recent bookings. The system 
receives an array of flight booking objects containing the flight ID and booking time (in 
YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss format). 
The booking records are stored in the order they were made, but the frontend requires the latest 
bookings to be shown first. 
 
 
2). You are building an e-commerce platform where customers can place orders. Each order 
contains multiple products, and each product has a unique ID, name, and quantity. However, 
sometimes a product appears multiple times within the same order due to user mistakes. 
Your system receives data in the following format: 
[ 
  { 
  orderId: "O101", 
  products: [ 
      { id: "P1", name: "Laptop", quantity: 1 
      }, 
      { id: "P2", name: "Mouse", quantity: 2 
      }, 
      { id: "P1", name: "Laptop", quantity: 1 
      } 
    ] 
  }, 
  { 
  orderId: "O102", 
  products: [ 
      { id: "P3", name: "Keyboard", quantity: 1 
      }, 
      { id: "P2", name: "Mouse", quantity: 1 
      }, 
      { id: "P3", name: "Keyboard", quantity: 1 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
] 
The system should merge duplicate products within each order, summing up their quantities 
instead of keeping separate entries.
