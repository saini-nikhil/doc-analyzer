Recipe Instructions
**Kheer (Rice Pudding)**

**Yields:** 6-8 servings
**Prep time:** 15 minutes
**Cook time:** 20-25 minutes

**Ingredients:**

* 1 cup basmati rice, rinsed thoroughly
* 4 cups whole milk
* 1/2 cup granulated sugar (or to taste)
* 1/4 cup chopped nuts (almonds, pistachios, cashews - or a mix!) 
* 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder
* 2-3 tablespoons raisins (optional)
* A pinch of saffron strands (optional, for color and flavor - soak in 1 tablespoon warm milk
for 10 minutes before adding)

**Instructions:**

1. In a heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the rinsed rice and milk. Bring to a boil over
medium heat, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking.
2. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer for 15-20
minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the milk has thickened slightly. Stir occasionally to
prevent burning.
3. Stir in the sugar, cardamom powder, and soaked saffron (if using). Continue to simmer
for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Stir in the chopped nuts and raisins (if using).  Cook for another 2-3 minutes until heated
through.
5. Remove from heat and let the kheer cool slightly before serving.  Serve warm or chilled.
6. Garnish with extra chopped nuts or a sprinkle of cardamom powder before serving.
